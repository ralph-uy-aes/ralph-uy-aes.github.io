## A Fresh Start
Every semester, we get the opportunity to rebuild our identity. I always look forward to this opportunity as I tend to adjust to others, rather than have others adjust to me. I don't have a very strong personality after all. But what has this implied for me as a college student? I believe that not having a strong sense of self has had its pros and cons. As an example of a pro, I am extremely flexible with nearly every everything. When I'm put in a new environment, I tend to rely on what I've learned from the past in the first few days, but I soon realize that I can only rely so much on what I've learned and that I must adapt. A practical example of this was the past couple weeks of the new semester when I was trying to figure out my schedule and everything that I needed to succeed in all my classes. I practically tried every possible combination of going to the gym, going to work, and going to school. And if I hadn't I've already considered it through thought. Although frustrating, this has led me to a highly ideal and balanced schedule by the second week of the semester.

However, I believe that this highly adaptive lifestyle has also led to a vague sense of self. I often don't know how to react to things because it's hard to remember what the appropriate reaction is based on my identity. Naturally, this problem has plagued me for almost every aspect of my life that requires me to deal with other people. I want to develop a stronger identity this semester and I believe that this class could contribute to that, even if just by a small amount.

## Software Engineering
When I think of Software Engineering or just Engineering as a whole, I imagine a group of bright people collaborating towards a mutually beneficial goal. But one thing to note is that they're not working together simply because they're the smartest in their field, rather it is often the case that it's because they are able to bear with each other. This is something that is often overlooked in Computer Science and unfortunately, it leads to unprepared software engineers. After all, how will you communicate with your clientele if you can't even communicate with your team? This is another aspect of software engineering that I am looking forward to honing. I want to be able to collaborate with other students and create highly functional software.
