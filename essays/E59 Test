# E59: Deploy nextjs-application-template

For this experience, you will learn how to deploy the nextjs-application-template app to Vercel in order to make it available for anyone to use who has access to the Internet and a browser.  You will also learn how to monitor your "production" database at Vercel, and how to set up application performance monitoring.

To do this, perform all the steps in the following readings in order:

  1. [How to deploy a Nextjs application to Vercel](./reading-vercel.html).
  2. [How to inspect your Postgresql database on Vercel using pgAdmin](https://dykraf.com/blog/connect-vercel-postgresql-into-pgadmin4)

If you are getting errors, that you don't understand how to resolve, feel free to ask a #smart-question.

### Submission

By the date and time indicated on the Calendar page, please finish all of these steps. Create three screenshots:

  1. Your Nextjs application (retrieved using a URL like "https://my-nextjs-application-rho.vercel.app/").
  2. Your pgAdmin screen showing a connection to your Nextjs application.

Ok, Ill do that too. Does that one have to be done by today?
Dan Port â€” 2:32 PM
I think so because this is the one that suggests using PostgreSQL database in Vercel
rui â€” 2:33 PM
Oh ok then I can do that
Dan Port â€” 2:33 PM
Which apparently they don't offer anymore. Only through third-parties like Supabase 
Please update it in the way that you managed to get it working 
thanks Ralph!
