# E59: Deploy nextjs-application-template

For this experience, you will learn how to deploy the nextjs-application-template app to Vercel in order to make it available for anyone to use who has access to the Internet and a browser.  You will also learn how to monitor your "production" database at Vercel, and how to set up application performance monitoring.

To do this, perform all the steps in the following readings in order:

  1. [How to deploy a Nextjs application to Vercel](./reading-vercel.html).
  2. [How to inspect your Supabase database on Vercel using pgAdmin](https://dykraf.com/blog/connect-vercel-postgresql-into-pgadmin4)

If you are getting errors, that you don't understand how to resolve, feel free to ask a #smart-question.

### Submission

By the date and time indicated on the Calendar page, please finish all of these steps. Create two screenshots:

  1. Your Nextjs application (retrieved using a URL like "https://my-nextjs-application-rho.vercel.app/").
  2. Your pgAdmin screen showing a connection to your Nextjs application.

Post them to the #deployment channel.
